#
# Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers
# in numsÂ such that the sum is closest toÂ target. Return the sum of the three
# integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.
# 
# The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
# 
#

    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
