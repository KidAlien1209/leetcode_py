#
# Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find
# two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
# 
# The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they
# add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may
# not use the same element twice.
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [1,2]
# Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
# 
#
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        i = 0
        j = len(numbers)-1
        while i < j:
            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target:
                return [i+1,j+1]
            elif numbers[i] + numbers[j] < target:
                i+=1
            elif numbers[i] + numbers[j] > target:
                j-=1
        return []
